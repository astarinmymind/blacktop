|  **`npm run server`**   | This command starts the server with nodemon, which restarts the server every time a change is made. The server is default to run on port 5000. This is identical to command 'nodemon index.js'          |
|  **`npm run client`**    | This command is starts up a client on port 3000. This is identical to the command `cd client && npm start`. |
|     **`npm run dev`**     | This command runs both the client and the server at the same time. This is identical to opening two terminals and running npm run server in one and npm run client in the other |
